I'm gathering examples and trasnlating them into Pluto Notebooks.

## Environment setup

**You can use [this helper tool](https://fonsp.com/article-test-3/pkghelper.html) to generate these commands!**

**Important to note:**

-   Place the Pkg commands and the imports in the same cell.
-   You can use the same setup when running your notebook locally. Julia will re-use existing package installations, so this will only download and install packages the first time.

_In the future, Pluto will automate this process for you!_

## Homepage setup

If you go to the (GitHub Pages) URL of repository, you will see a small index of the notebooks in this repository. You can customize this page, two options are:

-   Create your own `index.html` or `index.md` file, it will be used as the homepage.
-   Rename one of your notebooks to `index.jl`, and it will be the default notebook!
